# The Needle In The Haystack
## A javascript front game
This game has a back-end and a front-end. Only The front-end part is on GitHub.
The back-end is a REST API developped with Symfony4.
The front-end is a javascript / jQuery web app.

## News
It works! You can give it a try, and tell me about the gameplay and device compatibility.
But if you want to make everything work (score registration, finish screen display), you'll need a back-end access. Actually, the Git repo is to me a version manager.
